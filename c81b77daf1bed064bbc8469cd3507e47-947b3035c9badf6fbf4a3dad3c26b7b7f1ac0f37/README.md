## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

For my final part of this project, I have decided to change my idea a little bit so that it fits better with the project and so it has more of a narrative. I found with my previous version of the panda, there wasnt as many things as i would like to be able to randomise using parameters. 

My new idea is based off of mickey and minnie mouse. Where minnie mouse is the main "character/face" and mickey is the other character/face.

Minnie Mouse Changes:
	- Eyes randomly wink 
	- Head tilt slightly
	- Mouth opens and closes
	- Bow sides change colour

Mickey Mouse Changes
	- Head tilts a lot
	- mouth is more round when it opens and closes
	- Eyes blink

Changed the focus to 1 for minnie and had each mickey at different focuses (1, 3, 5) for my final as I like that it is a lot more randomised and less structured compared to having the focus set to 5 for every focusedRandom element. 

This helped to show that minnie is very happy and excitable but mickey is curious and tired.
